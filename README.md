## Project Overview

In January 2020, the emergence of COVID-19 prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern." Subsequently, in March 2020, the WHO elevated its status to a global pandemic [1]. The ensuing events had profound impacts on societies worldwide, challenging our resilience and underscoring the need for comprehensive data analysis.

This GitHub project leverages data from Our World in Data [2] to conduct a meticulous [Data Cleaning and Preparation](https://github.com/fabiohsst/Covid_cases/blob/main/dashboard_query.sql) process. The objective is to offer a refined dataset for the creation of an insightful dashboard. The dashboard provides a visual representation of critical COVID-19 metrics, enabling users to explore and comprehend the pandemic's global and regional dynamics.

### Key Dashboard Metrics:

1. **Death Percentage (World):** Visualize the global death percentage, providing a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact on mortality.

2. **Total Death Cases per Continent:** Explore the distribution of total death cases across continents, highlighting regional variations in the severity of the pandemic.

3. **Population Infected:** Gain insights into the overall proportion of the global population affected by COVID-19, contributing to a broader understanding of its scale.

4. **Population Infected per Country:** Drill down into country-specific data, examining the infection rates relative to each nation's population.

### Explore the Dashboard:

This project aims to facilitate informed decision-making and foster a deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact on a global scale.
